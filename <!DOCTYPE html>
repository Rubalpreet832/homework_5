      <h1><strong>Clone this page</strong> </h1>  
    <p>The goal of this assignment is to replicate this page,to the beat of your ability,without having seen the HTML  code</p>
     <p>The exercise will help you understand how to break a webpage into sections in your mind before creating the code,which will allow you to code much more efficiently.</p>
     <ul>
     <u>Take a note to replicate things like:</u>
     <li>Size of headers in relation to other headers.</li>
     <li>The target value of links(they will state whether they open in new tab or not)</li>  
     <li>ul vs ol vs dl option ,with list-type specifications</li>
     </ul>
     <p><strong>You will be recreating this entire page,however in place of the assignment details, use lorem ipsum as a space filler</strong></p>
     <h1>This <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="blank">Link </a> will open Google in a new tab</h1>
     <h2>This <a href="/home/rubalpreet/forms.html"> Link</a> will open a second HTML document,in the same browser tab,and the second page will contains 100 words of lorem ipsum ,and a link that will return back to the main HTML document.</h2>
 <h3>This <a href="/home/rubalpreet/Documents/thirdwebpage.html"  target="blank"> Link</a> will open a third HTML document,in the new browser tab ,containing an image of your choice,with a description of the photo below,as well as a link back to the main page.</h3>

     <li>1st item in list</li>
     <li>2nd item</li>
     <li>3rd item</li>
     </ol>
     <ul style="list-style-type:square">

       &nbsp;  &nbsp;this is additional information about the 2nd item
     <li>3rd item in 2nd list</li>
     
       &nbsp; &nbsp;this is additional information about the 3rd item
